<div class="jumbotron">
	<h1>Welcome! I'm glad you're here :)</h1>
	<h3>Read the following instructions carefully and respond as you think best.</h3>
	<p>There are two buttons shown below. A yellow button and a red button. I would suggest that you click on the yellow button. Please don't click on the red button. But do be so kind and enter your email address in the input box provided if you are considering clicking on the yellow button. Assuming you do that be patient and at a certain as yet unspecified future date you will receive further instructions. You may still enter your email address even if you decide on the red button. But I wouldn't recommend it. Just kidding!</p>
